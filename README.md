 AartiStudio Website

A single-page art portfolio and events website built with Next.js and TypeScript.  
The site uses Google Sheets as a lightweight CMS so content can be updated without modifying code.

Build a clean, responsive website where:
- Featured artworks are displayed in a slideshow
- Past and upcoming events are listed dynamically
- Content is managed through Google Sheets instead of a custom admin dashboard

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)

- Vercel (planned deployment)

## Status

In Progress
